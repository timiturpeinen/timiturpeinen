### [*Analysis of shot probability in NBA games using Bayesian modeling*](https://github.com/timiturpeinen/Projects/blob/main/Bayesian_Modeling_Project_Report%20(4).pdf)

### Abstract
In this project, we utilize Bayesian modeling to analyze shot efficiency in the NBA, focusing on both temporal and spatial factors. Using publicly available shot-by-shot data \cite{Data}, we develop two primary models. One is designed to assess the time-based effects of shot efficiency and the second assesses the spatial effects of the shot efficiency on the court.

One of the main findings of this project is that the time plays little to no effect on the probability of making a shot. On the other hand, spatial effects influence the probability a lot. We find that there are three distinct efficient areas that maximize the expected points of a shot. These areas are the close proximity of the hoop, the corner three point zone, and the middle three point zone. The long two point shots should also be avoided, as they provide the worst expected number of points. These findings are meant to provide guidance to analysts and coaches in the NBA and other leagues on what shots are the best to take and which shots should not be taken. We also perform this analysis out of scientific curiosity to apply Bayesian methods in difficult tasks, with a lot of data.

### [Bacherlor's thesis: *Korkeaulotteisten äärellisten joukkojen upotukset*]()

### Abstract
In this thesis, we derive the Johnson-Lindenstrauss theorem and explore its applications. The theorem addresses the embedding of high-dimensional points into lower-dimensional spaces while preserving distances, a process known as high-dimensional reduction. The theorem also has numerous applications in various computational methods. Deriving the theorem requires backgroundknowledge in the concepts of volumes of $n$-dimensional sets, measure theory, metric spaces, topology, and probability theory. The derivation of the main result begins with the Brunn-Minkwoski inequality, which holds for all compact sets. This inequality can be used to prove the general isoperimetric inequality. The isoperimetric inequality is, in turn, useful for examining the measure concentration on the sphere. In this thesis, the measure concentration is used to prove Lévy’s lemma which generally applies to every 1-Lipschitz function. As a result of the properties of projection functions, Lévy’s lemma can be used in the proof of the main theorem. Finally, in the end we discuss the purpose and useful applications of the main theorem in numerical methods.

### [*Large Deviations and Applications*](https://github.com/timiturpeinen/Projects/blob/main/Large_Deviations_and_Applications.pdf)

### Preface
In this paper, we address several exercises related to large deviations and their applications. Specifically, we will solve problems from the book "*Large Deviations Techniques
and Applications*" by Amir Dembo and Ofer Zeitouni [1](https://nzdr.ru/data/media/biblio/kolxoz/M/MV/MVsa/Dembo%20A.,%20Zeitouni%20O.%20Large%20deviations%20techniques%20and%20applications%20(2ed.,%20Springer,%202010)(ISBN%209783642033100)(O)(415s)_MVsa_.pdf). We adopt the same notation as the book and all theorems and lemmas we cite are from the given book, unless they are standard results from the probability theory. We assume the reader is familiar with these standard theorems. 

In section 2, we first examine the Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for finite-dimensional spaces, and then extend it to the specific cases of R and Rd. While the focus is primarily on i.i.d. samples, an extension to non-i.i.d. scenarios is explored in section 2.3. Finally, section 2.4 delves into concentration inequalities from an LDP perspective. In section 3 we study the applications of the LDP in finite-dimensional settings, e.g., for Markov processes.
